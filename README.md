# Combinational Circuit Simulator
A combinational circuit simulator web for Windows written in python.




# Features
- Simulate combinational ciruits design.
- Accepts a description of circuit in simple text file(format for test ciruits).
- Randomly generate binary inputs (using bin-python) for verifying ciruit design.
- save and store Inputs generated and output got according to design.
- Download Inputs and outputs data file.
- Ui also show these datasets.
- Can solve large ciruit correctly in less time.
